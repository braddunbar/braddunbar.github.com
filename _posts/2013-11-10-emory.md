Nearly two years as a parent and I feel only marginally better at it.  My
second daughter was born Monday, October 28<sup>th</sup> 2013 weighing in at 6
lbs 10 oz and measuring 18.5 inches long.  This one seemed easier, though maybe
I've just been steeled over the last two years.

I recently read that you get ~940 Saturdays between your child's birth and
their departure for college.  I intend to make them count.
