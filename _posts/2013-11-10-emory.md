Nearly two years as a parent and I feel only marginally better at it. My
second daughter was born Monday, October 28<sup>th</sup> 2013 weighing in at 6
lbs 10 oz and measuring 18.5 inches long.

The difficulty of having children is only outmatched by the fun. I recently
read that you get ~940 Saturdays between your child's birth and their departure
for college and I intend to make them count.
