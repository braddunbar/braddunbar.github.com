One summer evening during a break from college, my sister Jade and I decided
that we would go fishing the next morning. There's a pond behind my parents'
house and a canoe that we liked to row around in. We don't really fish, but it
sounded like a good enough activity for a lazy summer day. We talked about the
bait we'd use and how many fish we would catch and then went to bed.

The next morning I, being the lazy college student I was, overslept and we
didn't even get to go fishing. Jade had an appointment of some sort that day
and I had been thoughtless and didn't consider it. By the time I got up Jade
was leaving but she spared my feelings as she left, telling me it was no big
deal.

She had carefully put up the fishing poles and paddles but on the kitchen
counter I found a note, scrawled on pink and yellow paper. She had drawn a big
heart and written "Gone Fishing" inside of it so anyone coming through would
know where we were. I know she was disappointed but she never mentioned it to
me again.

I don't remember what the pond looked like, what appointment Jado went to, or
what else I did that day, but I do have a clear picture of that note in my
head. I think of it often and carry it with me as a talisman, reminding me to
do the things I say I'll do and to be more like Jade, enthusiastic and
forgiving.

Later Tater. ðŸ’ž
