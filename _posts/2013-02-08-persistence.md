[Dave Winer][scripting] succintly states my feelings on collaborative software development in a quote from [Ars Technica][article].

> Eventually you come around to his way of thinking, or he comes around to yours. These are the essential ingredients in good technology. We're looking for the right answer, not to be proven right, or to prove the other guy wrong.

Looking for the right answer, together.
