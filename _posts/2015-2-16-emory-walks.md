On Saturday, as we packed to come home from NYC, Emory decided that it was time
to start walking! It's hard to explain just how exciting it is, but maybe you
can imagine. After a year of caring for this tiny person, we're still on the
right track. We're doing alright, despite the mess-ups, hurry-ups, and
clean-ups.
